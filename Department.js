                <p className="event_disc">The infrastructural facilities along with a congenial atmosphere for
learning enable all our students to excel in curricular and co-curricular
activities. VIT has always been at the forefront and achieved several
accolades across the globe and our journey, indeed, is long. VIT is aware
that technological developments remarkably contribute to societal
transformation. This is manifested during our annual technomanagement fest “graVITas’. ‘graVITas’ 19 provides opportunities to
ignite and innovate the young minds to demonstrate their technical
skills. The theme of graVITas 2019 is “Technology Driven
Transformation” which intends to offer simple and novel solutions to the
challenges faced by the common people.
There are a plethora of events in graVITas'19 covering almost every
domain in emerging areas. To name a few, VIT-Model United Nations
(VIT-MUN), The Rover Challenge, Drone League, Business idea
competition, Social Transformers will emphasize the ethical and
technological skills of the students. Also, the technical workshops and
hands-on training sessions, VIT HACK [comprising of Make-a-Thon, Hacka-Thon, Idea-a-Thon, Design-a-Thon, Chem-a-Thon] will technically
entertain and enrich the students’ innovative skills. In addition to the
events, we are hosting an International Conference on “Nano in
Engineering, Science, and Technology (iNEST) and the accepted papers in
the conference will be published in the form of proceedings/book
chapters. We assure that this year’s technical extravaganza is certain to
grab the attention of techno buffs and will provide a platform to
showcase their academic excellence. All the engineering and science
students of VIT and other institutes are expected to participate in this
event
