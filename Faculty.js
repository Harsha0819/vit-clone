<p className="info">Academic Staff College (ASC) is dedicated towards creating a culture of
academic excellence and conducting faculty development activities for all our
schools and centers at VIT Vellore. We conduct regular dialogue with different
stakeholders of the university and coordinate with schools and centers
towards achieving our purpose. Faculty Orientation Program(FOP) is our
month long flagship event conducted once every year to induct the new
faculty as they join our family. The regular faculty development programs are
conducted in half day, one or two day and 5-day formats to cater to different
needs of our existing faculty across domains and disciplines all through the
year. The Faculty development programs are designed to ensure all round
development and well-being of our faculty members. We also network with
international resource persons and universities as well as industry experts
and invite the best resource persons to our university. We help our faculty
stay updated with the latest developments in teaching, research and
technology and thus to create a world class learning environment for our
students.</p>
